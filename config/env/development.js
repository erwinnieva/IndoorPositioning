	// To connect to MongoDB, you will need to use MongoDB connection URI.  The MongoDB connection URI is a string URL that tells the MongoDB
	// drivers how to connect to the database instance.  The MongoDB URI is usually constructed as follows:
	//	mongodb://username:password@hostname:port/database
	// Since you are connecting local instance, you can skip the username and password and use the following URI:
	//	mongodb://localhost/database_name
	db: 'mongodb://localhost/capstone'
